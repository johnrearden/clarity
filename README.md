## UX/UI

The UX/UI design for Clarity follows a structured approach based on the five planes of user experience: (See [Planning and Development Process](#planning-and-development-process) and [Plan and Kanban](./planning-resources/Plan-and-Kanban.md) for more detail.)

### Strategy
- Created user stories to define project objectives and user needs
- Primary goal: Provide a supportive resource for individuals dealing with mental health challenges

### Scope
- Outlined core features based on user stories:
  
  MVP-
  - Easy navigation
  - supportive design:
  - Mobile accessibility
  - Emotion information section
  - Coping strategies section
  Extra-content
  - Mindfulness resources
  - External help resources
  - Contact form

- Outlined some nice to have features for future development

### Structure
- Chose a single-page layout for ease of navigation
- Planned to implement smooth scrolling between sections
- Planned information architecture to present emotional information effectively

### Skeleton
- Designed wireframes incorporating all key sections - See intial wireframes in planning document [Plan and Kanban](./planning-resources/Plan-and-Kanban.md)

[Wireframe1](./README-images/wireframes/1.png)<br> [Wireframe2](./README-images/wireframes/2.png)<br> [Wireframe3](./README-images/wireframes/3.png)<br> [Wireframe4](./README-images/wireframes/4.png)
- Ensured logical flow of information

### Surface

## Testing

### Validator Testing
- HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  - [Validated code](./README-images/validated/html-validated.png)
- CSS: No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) [validated code](./README-images/validated/css-validated.png)

### Manual Testing
- The website was tested on various browsers (Chrome, Edge, DuckDuckGo, Safari) and devices (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) to ensure responsiveness and functionality
- All links were checked to ensure they are working correctly and open in new tabs where appropriate
- The contact form was tested to ensure it submits correctly and provides appropriate feedback to the user (Feedback needs improving - Autofill not functional, there was a warning/error message in devtools about this)

### Bugs and Fixes

#### Fixed Bugs
1. Hero background image height issue: Adjusted image positioning to resolve layout problems when the hamburger menu was opened
2. Full-width layout: Removed padding from containers for nav and hero sections
3. Card centering: Centered cards in the Emotions section within their container
4. Card growth space: Added space above cards to accommodate hover effect growth
5. Carousel image consistency: Adjusted the journaling image in the carousel to match the height of other images
6. Deployed image display: Fixed issues with images not showing in the deployed version

#### Unfixed Bugs
1. Form title: The "RSVP" title on the contact form modal needs to be changed to a more appropriate title
2. Mobile swipe inconsistency: Swipe functionality on the coping strategies carousel works inconsistently across different mobile devices and sometimes requires a refresh in mobile emulators and desktop
I think it may have something to do with this invalid keyframe error in the console, but ive only seen it once as the issue is temporomental [Console Log Error](./README-images/console-logs/Screenshot%202024-10-02%20105743.png)

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps:

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
3. Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment

## Planning and Development Process

The development of Clarity followed a unique and innovative approach, leveraging AI assistance for enhanced planning and content creation:

1. **AI-Assisted Planning**: The project planning was conducted in conversation with Anthropic's Claude AI. This method was chosen to facilitate a more fluid ideation process and ensure alignment between planning and content creation.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: The planning process resulted in a solid foundation and permanent record that can be easily edited and reused as a template for future projects.

3. **Structured Approach**: The planning began with a UX/UI design flow chart and project brief criteria. Each part of the design process, from user stories to user testing, was discussed in detail.

4. **Kanban Board Creation**: A rudimentary Kanban board was created, listing tasks for each plane of the UX design process. This served as a progress tracking tool throughout the project.

5. **Iterative Development**: The development process involved moving through each stage, discussing content, functionality, and implementation with Claude AI. The AI was prompted to act as a tutor, providing guidance without directly creating code unless specifically asked to explain certain structures and components.

6. **Documentation**: The full plan and Kanban board can be found here: [Plan and Kanban](./planning-resources/Plan-and-Kanban.md)

This approach allowed for a thorough exploration of ideas, consistent alignment between planning and execution, and a well-documented development process.

## AI Assistance

Throughout the development of Clarity, AI assistance was utilized in various aspects of the project. Here are some key areas where AI, specifically Claude, provided support:

1. **Smooth Scrolling Implementation**: The smooth scrolling navigation was implemented with guidance from Claude AI. The AI provided explanations and suggestions for creating a smooth scrolling effect that adjusts for the height of the navbar.

2. **Carousel Functionality**: The interactive carousel in the Coping Strategies section was developed with AI assistance. Claude helped in adapting and modifying existing carousel code to fit the project's specific needs, including touch event handling for mobile devices.

3. **Responsive Design**: AI was consulted for responsive design techniques, ensuring the website looks and functions well across various device sizes.

4. **Content Creation**: While the core content was mostly AI written, I refined and expanded on certain sections, ensuring clarity and consistency in tone and formatting.

5. **Debugging**: When encountering bugs, such as the hero image height issue or carousel image consistency, AI was consulted for potential solutions and best practices.

6. **Code Optimization**: AI provided suggestions for optimizing code structure and improving performance, particularly in JavaScript functions.

It's important to note that while AI was a valuable tool in the development process, all final decisions and implementations were made by myself. The AI served as a guide and collaborator, enhancing the development process rather than replacing human creativity and decision-making. Here is a messsage from Claude regarding our planning process.
